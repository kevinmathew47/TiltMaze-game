# Tilting Maze üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Tilting Maze

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Kevin Mathew - Saintgits College of Engineering (Autonomous), Kottayam 


### Project Description
Tilting Maze is a mobile-friendly browser game where you roll a ball through a procedurally generated maze by tilting your device. It features motion controls (with a desktop mouse fallback), simple physics with wall collisions, adaptive difficulty each level, ambient Web Audio music, and an optional avatar mode that maps your photo onto the ball.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People keep holding their phones perfectly still. That‚Äôs unacceptable. Also, labyrinths aren‚Äôt portable enough for today‚Äôs fast-paced procrastination needs.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A tilt-powered maze that rewards wobbly wrists. Tip your phone and watch your face roll to victory through a thousand procedural corridors.
